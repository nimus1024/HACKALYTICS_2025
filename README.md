# Hacklytics_2025
 An application developed during Hackalytics 2025. Personalized Speech-to-Text Generator for People with Speech Disabilities
# Personalized Speech-to-Text for Children with Down Syndrome

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a personalized speech-to-text generator specifically designed to accurately transcribe the speech of children with Down syndrome. Recognizing that standard speech recognition tools often struggle with non-standard speech patterns, this application leverages generative AI to dynamically adapt and learn a user's unique speech characteristics over time.

We are addressing the challenge of delayed speech development, pronunciation difficulties, and complex sentence formation common in children with Down syndrome, by creating a tool that improves transcription accuracy through real-time learning and user feedback.

## Features

*Voice Recording: A user-friendly microphone interface for capturing speech input.
*Real-Time Transcription: Immediate text transcription with incremental learning capabilities.
*Personalized Adaptation:** The AI model learns and adapts to individual speech patterns over time, improving accuracy.
*User Feedback Mechanism: An intuitive interface for users to correct mis-transcriptions, allowing the model to refine its accuracy based on direct feedback.
*Personalization: A short voice training period enables the system to rapidly create a personalized speech model.

## Technologies Used

* [Specify the pre-trained speech-to-text model you choose, e.g., Whisper, Google Speech API]
* [Specify the programming language, e.g., Python]
* [Specify any relevant libraries, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.]
* [Specify any UI libraries, e.g., React, Flutter, etc.]

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    [Instructions on how to run the application]
    ```

## How It Works

The application utilizes a pre-trained speech-to-text model as a foundation. A generative AI layer is then implemented to personalize the transcription process. This layer continuously refines its accuracy based on user input and corrections. The user can train the system with a brief voice sample, creating a personalized model that adapts to their unique speech patterns.

## Target Audience

This tool is specifically designed for children with Down syndrome and their caregivers/strangers, providing a more reliable and accurate speech-to-text solution.

## Future Improvements

* Expanding the training data to include a wider range of speech patterns.
* Implementing more advanced generative AI techniques for improved personalization.
* Developing a mobile application for greater accessibility.
* Implementing different languages.
* Improving the user interface based on user feedback.
